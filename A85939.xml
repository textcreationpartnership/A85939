            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether the King (con≈øidering his Oath at Coronation to protect the Clergy and their Priviledges) can</hi> ≈øalv√¢ con≈øcienti√¢ <hi>con≈øent to the abrogation of Epi≈øcopacy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affirmation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I con≈øider, fir≈øt, That there is no hope of the Kings or Kingdomes ≈øafety, without an union between our King and <hi>Parliament.</hi> Secondly, that ≈øuch an union is <hi>tantum non</hi> impo≈ø≈øible, unle≈ø≈øe the King conde≈øcend in the point of Epi≈øcopacy. Thirdly, for the King to conde≈øcend <hi>renitente con≈øeienti√¢,</hi> though it might gratifie us, it would be ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him, and ≈øo he ≈øhould forfeit inward to procure outward peace, and be repre≈øented to times in the gla≈ø≈øe of Con≈øcience, to adventure the Heavenly to retaine an earthly Crowne. Fourthly, the Oath taken at the Kings Coronation hath been pre≈øt by ≈øome learned pens with that probablity, that may ≈øtumble a right intelligent Reader, neither have they that I know, received any ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory An≈øwer in print. I conceive it may be a work worthy ≈øome paines to re≈øolve this ca≈øe, and cleere your objections, that while they ≈øtand unan≈øwered, ca≈øt an ill reflexion both upon the King in conde≈øcending to abrogate Epi≈øcopacie, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> in pre≈ø≈øing him to it. Now the bond of the Kings Oath may be taken off two wayes. Either by cleering the unlawfulne≈ø≈øe of it that it was <hi>vinculum iniquitatis,</hi> and ≈øo voide the fir≈øt day, for <hi>qui jurat in iniquum obligatur in contrarium.</hi> And if Prelacy in the Church be an u≈øurpation contrary to Chri≈øts in≈øtitution, then to maintaine it is to ≈øinne, and all bonds to ≈øinne are fru≈øtrate. And truly, as Prelacy ≈øtood with us in <hi>England,</hi> ingro≈ø≈øing all ruledome in the Church into the hands of a few Lord Bi≈øhops, I thinke it may be cleered to be an u≈øurpation by this one Argument. <hi>That Power that de≈øpoyles any of Chri≈øts Officers of any Priviledge, or duty indulged or injoyned them by the word of God; that power is an u≈øurpation again≈øt the word. But this Prelacy did, as it ≈øtood in England. Ergo, Engli≈øh Prelacy was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113655:3"/>an u≈øurpation again≈øt the word of God.</hi> The Major is cleere of it ≈øelf. The Minor is thus proved. Presbyters are by Chri≈øts warrant in Scripture indued with power to rule in their owne Congregations, as well as preach; ≈øee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. and 5.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 5.12.</p>
            <p>Now as Prelacy ≈øtood in <hi>England,</hi> the Presbyters were not onely excluded from all ≈øociety in Rule, but which was much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the dignity, and liberty of the Mini≈øtery, were ≈øubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to a lay Chancelour; and was not here u≈øurpation again≈øt Gods direction?</p>
            <p>But though this way of invalidating the Kings Oath be mo≈øt ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to ≈øome, yet to tho≈øe that are not convinc't of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈ø≈øe of Epi≈øcopacy it will not hold, and ≈øo it would ca≈øt the re≈øolution of this doubt about the Oath, upon another Que≈øtion touching the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of Epi≈øcopacy, which is a larger field. I ≈øhall therefore indeavour to ≈øhew that though for Argument ≈øake it be granted that Epi≈øcopacy be lawfull, yet notwith≈øtanding that his Oath, the King without impeachment may in this circum≈øtance con≈øent to the abrogation of Epi≈øcopacy.</p>
            <p>The u≈øuall way of cleering this a≈ø≈øertion is thus. The King is ≈øworne to maintaine the Lawes of the Land in force at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet no man que≈øtions, and the con≈øtant practi≈øe ≈øhewes; that it is not unlawfull after to abrogate any upon the motion or with the con≈øent of his <hi>Parliament.</hi> The meaning of the Oath being knowne to be to maintaine the Lawes while they are Lawes, but when they are abrogated by ju≈øt power in a regular way, they are then wiped out of his charge and Oath. So the King by his Oath is bound to maintaine the rights of the Clergy while they continue ≈øuch. But if any of their rights be abrogated by ju≈øt power, he ≈øtands no longer ingaged to that particular: And this I conceive to be a ≈øound re≈øolution. For the Kings Oath is again≈øt acting or ≈øuffering a tyrannous inva≈øion on Lawes and rights, not again≈øt a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary alteration of either.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A namele≈ø≈øe Author in a Book implea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all war again≈øt the King.</note>But here ≈øteps in my fir≈øt opponent, and though he di≈øpute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øtly, onely propo≈øing what he holds forth to ≈øerious con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he objects ≈øubtlely and his di≈øcour≈øe runs thus. <hi>The Oath for maintenance of Lawes is made</hi> populo Anglicano <hi>to the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ≈øo may be taken off by a future Act, becau≈øe it is by their owne
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113655:3"/>con≈øent repre≈øented in Parliament. But the Oath to maintaine the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Clergy, is made to ≈øuch a part of his people</hi> clero Anglicano, <hi>and particularly taken by him after his Oath to the whole Realme, which were needle≈ø≈øe unle≈ø≈øe it meant ≈øome other obligation. This ≈øeems (≈øaith the learned Author) to make it a di≈øtinct obligation, and not relea≈øable without the Clergies con≈øent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I an≈øwer. Taking it for granted that the Oath is thus taken by the King. That Oath was ≈øo framed, when <hi>Clerus Anglicanus</hi> the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> was a di≈øtinct ≈øociety or Corporation (as I may ≈øo ≈øay) <hi>√† populo Anglicano,</hi> from the people of <hi>England.</hi> This di≈øtinction between the Clergy and Laity we may ob≈øerve in our Hi≈øtorians. <hi>Daniel</hi> in the life of <hi>William</hi> the fir≈øt, gives this for a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon why the Clergy did ≈øo willingly conde≈øcend to him, becau≈øe they had their Province apart, whence they ≈øuppo≈øed a ≈øecurity to their Priviledges, however the Laity were in≈ølaved.<note place="margin">

               </note> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Clergy and Laity were di≈øtinct bodies; the Clergie holding their rights by Priviledge di≈øtinct from the Lawes of the Land; an Oath to maintaine the Lawes of the Land ≈øecured not them: But as another body they had another Oath for their ≈øecurity. But now this di≈øtinction of the Clergie from the Laity, that they ≈øhould be a di≈øtinct Province of them≈øelves, being a branch of Popery, is with it quite extingui≈øht: And Laity and Clergie are now one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick, and under the ≈øame power and Rule. For all privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Clergie that are contrariant to the Lawes of the Land, were aboli≈øht in the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight. As undoubtedly that was, that any ≈øociety ≈øhould be exempt from ≈øecular power, for that was to ≈øet up two Supremacies. And therefore though the Oath be continued in that order that it was when the Laity and Clergie were di≈øtinct bodies; yet now that this di≈øtinction is abrogated,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113655:4"/>and they are made one, the oath to the Clergie cannot be ≈øtronger or more inviolable, then that to the Layetie for the pre≈øervation of the Lawes of the Land. Both ≈øubject to regular alteration.</p>
            <p>Who knowes not that one of the priviledges of the Clergie was, for the Bi≈øhops to ≈øit and vote in the hou≈øe of Peeres, yet that is aboli≈øht as incongruous to their calling. And then why may not the removall of their Eccle≈øia≈øticall juri≈ødiction be con≈øented to, as well, if it prove inconvenient and prejudiciall to the Church? The abolition of the one is no more again≈øt the oath, then of the other.</p>
            <p>Againe, when this oath was framed, the Church was indued with the ignorance of the times, with divers unlawfull immunities, in all which re≈øpects the oath was invalid, being <hi>vinculum iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> and ≈øome were pared off as light ≈øhined forth. And why may not the great Revenues of the Bi≈øhops with their ≈øole juri≈ødiction in ≈øo large a circuit, be indicted and convict to be again≈øt the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church; and it be found more for the glory of God, that both the Revenue be divided to maintaine a preaching Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery, and their juri≈ødiction al≈øo, for the better over≈øight and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of manners. And then is there as good a plea, notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the oath, to alter this u≈øele≈ø≈øe Anti-Evangelicall pompe and domination of a few, as to antiquate other immunities ari≈øing from the errour of the times, not the tenure of Scripture. Were indeed the priviledges in que≈øtion, ≈øuch as were for the advantage of the Church, to further her edification; or had the Prelates been good Stewards and innocent in the u≈øe of them; then had the plea car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a fairer ≈øhew: But there having been ≈øo many forfeitures by abu≈øe, and tho≈øe great promotions and juri≈ødictions, being as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy to a Spirituall ≈øouldier, as <hi>Sauls</hi> Armour to <hi>David;</hi> and ≈øo doe not further, but hinder the work of the Go≈øpel, where ≈øtrong holds are to be vanqui≈øht not by carnall pompe, but ≈øpirituall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture mighty through God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. I ≈øee no ju≈øt ingagement to maintaine ≈øuch comber≈øome greatne≈ø≈øe, adding onely glory to the per≈øon, not vigour to the maine work of a Mini≈øter of the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p>Againe, thus I angue. If the King may con≈øent to alter the Lawes of the Nation, notwith≈øtanding his oath, then ≈øo he may al≈øo the Clergies immunities. For tho≈øe rights and immunities, they either
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113655:4"/>hold them by Law or otherwi≈øe. If by Law, then the <hi>Parliament</hi> which hath power to alter all Lawes, have power to alter ≈øuch Lawes as give them their immunities, and tho≈øe Lawes altered, the immunity cea≈øeth, and ≈øo the Kings ingagement in that particular. If their immunity be not by Law, it is either an u≈øurpation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ju≈øt title, which upon di≈øcovery is null. Or it was given by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall power in times of darkne≈ø≈øe, which being an Antichri≈øtian u≈øurpation is long ≈øince aboli≈øht in this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Author illu≈øtrateth the force of his argument by an example hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth an inconvenience. Where publique Faith is given for money, it is not relea≈øeable by Parliament, without con≈øent of the party: for if it be, it is in effect no engagement: ≈øo &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> There's a great deale of difference between an ingagement made to per≈øons, on valuable con≈øideration, and that which is made <hi>gratis</hi> to an office or ≈øociety ≈øub≈øervient to publike good. Of the former kinde, is the ingagement to pay ≈øummes of money of whom they were borrowed for publike good, which is indi≈øpen≈øable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the con≈øent of the lender? Of the latter ≈øort, is this ingagement to the Engli≈øh Clergy. Now ingagements to a Society to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their rights, indulged for the per≈øonall worth of pre≈øent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents, or to promote the u≈øefulne≈ø≈øe of that office. If in their matters they prove prejudiciall to the office, or the ≈øucceeding offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers by their ill demeanour forfeit them, their ingagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes alterable: There's no inju≈øtice done to make a Law to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule, or alter this ingagement. There's no que≈øtion of power in the <hi>Parliament</hi> to over-rule it: for in the former ca≈øe of money, if King and <hi>Parliament</hi> ≈øhould ordaine relea≈øe of the ingagement, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement were gone in Law though not in equity; The Order would be valid in Law though injurious: So if there be no injurie, the King and <hi>Parliament</hi> may cancell any obligation. And where there is forfeiture by mi≈øcarriage, or the priviledge indulged to a Mini≈øtery (which ought to hold nothing but for publike good) proves prejudiciall; the abrogation will be ju≈øt as well as Legall, there will be no injury done.</p>
            <p>But take it at the wor≈øt, it is but for the King to get the Clergies con≈øent, and I hope in this ca≈øe they will not be ≈øo tenacious of their wealth, and honour, as to let the Crowne runne an hazard rather then lay down their Mitres, and indanger the whole Land to be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113655:5"/>brought to nothing rather then them≈øelves to moderation: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have a better conceit of the major part of them at this time, which will amount to a con≈øent, and that in this Authors judgement takes off the ≈øcruple about the oath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be≈øides this Argument, there be other in≈øinuations brought in by the faine Author, that it would be di≈øhonourable to the Kings memory, to be an unfortunate in≈øtrument to pull downe Cathedralls, and impoveri≈øh them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈ø.</hi> To aboli≈øh Prelacy, and ≈øeize the revenues of Prelates to private or civill Intere≈øt, undoubtedly could neither want ≈øtaine nor guilt. Such kind of impropriation as happened in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight was cried out of all the Chri≈øtian world over. <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam bonorum Eccle≈øia≈øticorum di≈ø≈øipationem cum dete≈øtando ≈øacrilegio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctam, tecum, &amp; cum bonis omnibus deploramus, ≈øcelus univer≈øo erbi commune,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Beza in re≈øp. ad Sarac. de gradibus mini≈øt. pag. ult.</hi> But who knowes not the great defect among≈øt us, of congruous maintenance for parochiall Pa≈øtors, by whom the worke of the Mini≈øtery is chiefly to be performed? And if tho≈øe large revenues of the Prelates were diverted to ≈øupply with ≈øufficient maintenance all the defective Pari≈øhes in <hi>England,</hi> there would be no danger of Sacriledge: And this would not be to ruine, but to rectifie the devotion of former ages, and turne pompe into u≈øe, and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into helps. A work, for which following generations ≈øhould not need to pity the King, as put upon it by misfortune: but ri≈øe up and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Had the motives of <hi>Heary</hi> the eight been as hone≈øt to ca≈øt off Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall u≈øurpation, as the Act was holy; and the improvement of Abby Lands, as conformable to Divine Law, as the di≈ø≈øolution of Abbies to the Rules of Divine wi≈ødome; He might not onely have been honourable in our Annals: but if I may ≈øo ≈øpeak, a Saint in our <hi>Calender.</hi> It was the defective circum≈øtances of actions in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves glorious, which made them a di≈øhonour to him, though ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Church, which ill circum≈øtances being avoided in the thing in que≈øtion, God and good men will highly approve it, which is the onely reall, and regardable honour. Thus far my fir≈øt opponent.</p>
            <p>My ≈øecond Antagoni≈øt exceeds the fir≈øt, both in ≈øubtlety, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorine≈ø≈øe;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113655:5"/>for he plainly affirmes,<note place="margin">A Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the covenant.</hi> pag. 72. 73. 74.</note> that the King cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øert Epi≈øcopacy without flat perjury; and hence falls foule, both on tho≈øe that would force him to it, and al≈øo on tho≈øe moderate Courtiers that for peace ≈øake coun≈øeld it. He di≈øputes thus <hi>There's difference between Lawes and Oathes; where the ≈øupreme</hi> jus Dominii <hi>is, there is a power above all Lawes, but not above their owne Oathes, in whom that power is; for Law bindes onely while it is a Law, that is, till it be repealed. But an Oath bindes as long as it plea≈øeth him to whom it is taken: The rea≈øon is, becau≈øe the ≈øubject of ≈øupreme Power may</hi> cede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re jure ≈øuo, <hi>and oblige him≈øelfe where before he was free: which if they doe by promi≈øe, Ju≈øtice bindes them to performance; but if by an Oath (the matter being lawfull) then are they bound in Religion, and Con≈øcience, for an Oath addes a religious bond unto God. If this were not ≈øo, no Oath were binding to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I an≈øwer. Fir≈øt, it's a ground laid downe by this Author in the ≈øame place; that no Oath is obligatory beyond the intention of it; and then I fir≈øt propo≈øe it to con≈øideration, whether the intention of this Oath be not only again≈øt a tyrannous inva≈øion on the rights of the Clergy, not again≈øt an orderly alteration of them, if any prove inconvenient, and to protect them again≈øt violence, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt legall wayes of change. For, fir≈øt, this is as much as it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall for a King to undertake, and therefore in right rea≈øon the Oath ≈øhould have no other ≈øen≈øe, if the words of the Oath will beare it, as the words of this Oath will. Secondly, this Oath to the Clergy, mu≈øt not be intended in a ≈øen≈øe incon≈øi≈øtent with the Kings Oath to the people, fir≈øt taken for their protection in their Lawes, and Liberties; for then the latter Oath would be a pre≈øent breach of the former, and ≈øo unlawfull. Now one of the priviledges of the people is, that the Peeres and Commons in <hi>Parliament,</hi> have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the con≈øent of the King, to alter whatever in any particular e≈øtate is inconvenient to the whole. And therefore he cannot after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ingage him≈øelfe to any partionlar e≈øtate, to exempt it from this power; for by that Oath at lea≈øt <hi>ce≈ø≈øit jure ≈øuo,</hi> in this Authors judgement. The Clergy and their priviledges are ≈øubject to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or they are not; I hope they will not now claime an exemption from ≈øecular power. But if they be under Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power, how can it rationally be conceived to be the meaning of the Kings Oath, to pre≈øerve the priviledges of the Clergy, again≈øt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113655:6"/>that power to which they are legally ≈øubject? or how were the Oath in that ≈øen≈øe con≈øi≈øtent with the priviledges of the Nation, formerly ≈øworn to by the King? If the Oath had ≈øuch a ≈øen≈øe in the times of Popery, when the Clergy were a di≈øtinct corporation; yet when that exemption was aboli≈øht, as a branch of Antichri≈øtian u≈øurpation, the change of their condition mu≈øt needs change the intention of the Oath, unle≈ø≈øe they will ≈øay, that the Crown ≈øtands ≈øtill ingaged to them, to maintaine ≈øuch priviledges, as by Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> were long ≈øince aboli≈øht; which is to make his Oath to them contrariant to that taken before, for the maintenance of the again≈øt legall alteration of their priviledges by <hi>Parliament,</hi> makes it unlawfull, and ≈øo not obligatory. And if it be not intended again≈øt legall alteration, the King may pa≈ø≈øe a Bill for the abolition of Epi≈øcopacy, when his Hou≈øes of <hi>Parliament</hi> think it convenient, and petition for it without violation of his Oath.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I an≈øwer from the expre≈ø≈øions in the Oath it ≈øelfe, as they are ≈øet downe by the ≈øame Author, pag. 74. <hi>To protect the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops, and their priviledges to his power, as every good King in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in right ought to protect, and defend the Bi≈øhops, and Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their government.</hi> Here you ≈øee the engagement put upon the King, is but to his power, <hi>as every good King ought in right to protect, &amp;c.</hi> Now ≈øuch power is no further then he can doe it without ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning again≈øt God, and being injurious to the re≈øt of his people. When then he hath interpo≈øed his Authority for them, and put forth all the power he hath to pre≈øerve them; if after all this he mu≈øt let them fall, or ≈øupport them with the blood of his good Subjects, and tho≈øe unwilling too to ingage their lives for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers priviledges; I thinke none need que≈øtion, but that he hath gone to the extent of his power, and as farre as good Kings are bound in right, for it is not equall to ingage the lives of ≈øome to uphold the honour of others; that were to be cruell to many thou≈øands, to be indulgent to a few. Suppo≈øe a King put a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander into a City, and give him an Oath to maintaine the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of it, and keep it for him to his power; and this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der keeps this Towne till he have no more ≈øtrength to hold it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe he force the Townes-men to armes, again≈øt that priviledge which he hath ≈øworne to maintaine; If this Governour now ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113655:6"/>this Towne upon compo≈øition, doth he violate his Oath? I thinke none will affirme it; Such is the ca≈øe with the King in this particular; when he hath gone as farre in their protection as is con≈øi≈øtent with the weale of other his Liege people, which he is ≈øworne to tender; he hath protected them to his power, and his obligation is no further by the words of the Oath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The onely objection (as I conceive) which lyeth again≈øt this is, that though it be not in the Kings power to uphold them, yet it is in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er not to con≈øent to their fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈ø.</hi> If the King ≈øhould be peremptory in denyall, what help would this be to them? ≈øuch peremptorine≈ø≈øe in this circum≈øtance might indanger his Crowne, not ≈øave their Mitres. Be≈øides, though it be in his power to deny a≈ø≈øent to their abolition, in a naturall ≈øen≈øe, becau≈øe <hi>voluntas non pote≈øt cogi,</hi> yet it is not in his power in a Morall ≈øen≈øe, becau≈øe he cannot now deny con≈øent without ≈øinne; for if he con≈øent not, there will evidently continue ≈øuch di≈øtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confu≈øion, as is mo≈øt repugnant to the weale of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which he is bound by the Rule of government, and his Oath to provide for.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I an≈øwer, that this opponent in this di≈øpute, argues upon this ground, that the <hi>Supremum jus Dominii,</hi> even that which is above all Lawes, is in the King; which under favour, I conceive in our State is a manife≈øt errour. There's a Supremacy in the King, and a Supremacy in the <hi>Parliament;</hi> but the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or the <hi>Supremum jus Dominii,</hi> that is over all Lawes, <hi>figere</hi> or <hi>refigere,</hi> to make or di≈øanull them at plea≈øure, is neither in the King nor in the Hou≈øes apart, but in both conjoyn'd. The King is the Supreme Magi≈øtrate from whom all power of execution of Lawes is legally derived. The <hi>Parliament</hi> is the Supreme Court, by which all other Courts which derive their power for executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Lawes from the King by his Commi≈ø≈øions are to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; and the King and the <hi>Parliament</hi> are the Supreme Power to make and di≈øanull Lawes. Sith then this <hi>Supremum jus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii,</hi> that is over all Lawes, is not in the King, He cannot lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make any ingagement to any, again≈øt the Lawes, and Legall rights of others; for that were not <hi>cedere jure ≈øuo,</hi> but <hi>alieno.</hi> This Oath then to the Clergy, cannot ingage him again≈øt the legall Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the people, or <hi>Parliament;</hi> which he is bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113655:7"/>one of which is to be ready by confirming needfull Pills, to relieve them again≈øt what≈øoever grievance they ≈øuffer from any. And thus, I thinke the ca≈øe is ≈øufficiently cleered, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the Kings Oath to the Clergy at his Coronation, he may con≈øent to the extirpation of Prelacy out of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
